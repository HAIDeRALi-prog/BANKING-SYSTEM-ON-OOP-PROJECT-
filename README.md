Key OOP Concepts:

Classes & Objects: Account (abstract base class) and BankAccount (derived class).

Encapsulation: Account data (like balance, accountNumber) are private members with public getters and setters.

Inheritance: BankAccount inherits from Account.

Polymorphism: Virtual functions for dynamic binding (createAccount, display, etc.).

Operator Overloading: Deposit (+) and withdraw (-) operators overloaded for BankAccount.

File Handling: Save/load data from text files (accounts.txt, transactions.txt).

Use Cases:

Admin:

Create, view, search, update, and delete accounts

View all accounts

User:

View account, deposit, withdraw, apply interest

View transaction history
